			<p class="lead">Starting now <small>({'1464651101'|human_date} to be exact)</small> the Cyan.TF TeamSpeak server will be shut down and replaced with a shiny new Discord server.</p>
			<div class="horizontal-divider"></div>
			<p class="lead"><q>Why Discord?</q> You may ask. Discord is <u>free</u> and simpler to configure. Plus, I can live a bit happier knowing that I'm not wasting money on a TeamSpeak server that will be empty a lot.</p>
			<p class="lead"><q>What will happen to my rank from the old server?</q> Your ranks will be moved over, plus the new permissions system allows me to give donors some perks on the server!</p>
			<p class="lead"><q>What advantages does Discord have over TeamSpeak?</q> A better text chat (emoji, text-to-speech, image sharing, embedded content), works in-browser (or you can download the desktop/mobile apps), a sexy UI~, DDoS &amp; user IP protection, and many more goodies.</p>
			<p class="lead"><q>More donor perks you say?</q> Though they aren't much, donors will have access to the text-to-speech feature to make a robot say obscenities and they get a lustful green name.</p>
			<p class="lead"><q>Okay, what will I need to use this new server?</q> You simply need an account on the Discord website and you can then connect to the server from your web browser. You can also download the Discord desktop or mobile app to connect and interact that way.</p>
