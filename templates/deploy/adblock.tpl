		<p class="lead">Ads help me pay for the various services that both the website and game server uses to make it the server everyone knows and loves. The ads served on this site are simple, non-intrusive banners that are far out of the way of any clickable content. We also never serve pop-up ads or ads that slide into view.</p>
		<p class="lead">If you could, whitelisting this site in your adblocker would help a ton. Better yet, simply <a href="{URL}/#donate" target="_blank">donating $5 or more</a> will allow you to hide ads on the site <u>forever!</u><sup>*</sup></p>
		<p class="lead">Have a good day!</p>
		<small class="text-muted"><sup>*</sup>If you've already donated and are still seeing ads then click <a href="{URL}/ticket" target="_blank">here</a> and create a ticket under <q>general support</q>.</small>
