		<p>Even a care-free server like ours has some rules and regulations to keep order. Below are some very basic rules that you are required to follow when playing in our server.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Cheating/hacking will result in a permanent ban. No exceptions.</li>
			<li>Pornographic &amp; gore sprays are not allowed. Your sprays will be banned if they break this rule.</li>
			<li>Impersonating staff results in lengthy bans.</li>
			<li>Threatening to hack, either the server or using hacks, will get you permanently banned.</li>
			<li>Exploiting or abusing certain features, of maps or server plugins, will result in bans.</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Telling other players about said exploitable features will result in bans.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>If you are going to play music, you must follow our <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal-large" data-remote="{base64_encode('/static/modals/music-rules.html')}">music playing rules.</a></li>
			<li>Being obnoxious or intentionally loud on your microphone will result in an extended mute lasting 12 to 24 hours.</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Flooding the chat in response to this will get you <b>silenced</b> (both muted and gagged) for an extended period of time or even permanently.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Only English is to be spoken in voice chat.</li>
			<li>Advertising/recruiting for other servers, groups, or any other community that is not part of the Cyan.TF network is forbidden.</li>
			<li>Racial slurs and other discriminatory language is not allowed in text or voice chat.</li>
			<ol>
				<li>While our word filter catches and punishes most of these infractions, it is not perfect. This does not give you the excuse to bypass the word filter. This shows that you have no respect for our rules and you will be banned.</li>
				<li>Encouraging other players to say something that triggers the word filter to get them kicked is interpretted as abusing the filter. If you are found to be doing this, you will be banned.</li>
				<li>Using the filter as a means of disconnecting, as in intentionally saying a bad word to get the filter to kick you, will be interpretted as evading and will result in a ban.</li>
				<ol>
					<li>If you want to be kicked by the filter, simply use the !kickme command.</li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
			<li>Binds that make you say things in chat is allowed as long as it conforms to the rules and is not spammed back-to-back.</li>
			<li>Bypassing a ban, such as using an alternative account, will result in an unappealable, permanent ban from all services.</li>
		</ol>
		<small style="opacity:0.3;">Players can and will be susceptible to punishments from infractions not listed in the above rules.</small>
