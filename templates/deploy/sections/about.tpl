		<p><b>Cyan.TF</b> is the older brother of the late Cute.TF (which was founded June 8<sup>th</sup> of 2014 as a small test/side project). Cyan.TF is a laid-back 100% crits server with a suite of whacky and unique plugins &amp; addons to create a distinctively different and enjoyable server environment.</p>
		<p>The server's plugins aren't all whacky, though. Being built to be autonomous, the server also houses various maintenance and anti-cheat plugins to maintain and moderate the server even if there is no administrator on.</p>

		<p>Cyan.TF first started out as <b>KWC</b>, Kill With Cuteness, back in mid 2014 and started out as a small orange crits server hosted on a Linux VPS. The server didn't initially gain many players and was then rebranded as Cute.TF. Even then the playerbase was very small. It was then decided to try something different, running stock maps, no plugins, and getting the server on TF2's quickplay. That failed horribly as it was empty nearly 24/7. It was promptly changed back and started slowly gaining players. When Halloween came around, event maps were added to the rotation which gained an influx of players. So much that a VPS upgrade was desperately needed.</p>

		<span class="horizontal-divider"></span>

		<p>Soon the entire brand was revamped as Cyan.TF when a new, proper server host came along. Now the server is running stronger than ever with nearly <em>10,000</em> unique connections.</p>
